## Welcome

First off, hello and welcome to the landing page of my app's documentation. My name is Calvin and I work in a sales capacity at Juniper Networks, and I am hoping that you find this project helpful.

This project will stand up an example Express application with a working REST API with a handful of functions. A mongodb database will provide the necessary feature of storing and retrieving data for our little app.

## Containers

### nodejs

A Dockerfile has been provided at [files/nodejs](https://github.com/cdot65/express-api-k8s/blob/main/files/nodejs/Dockerfile); it is based on `node:alpine` and simply executes our code after copying it into the `/usr/src/app` directory.

### mongodb

Our database platform will be based upon the official `mongo:latest` image and requires no modification, so the only trace of it will be found in the [files/docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/cdot65/express-api-k8s/blob/main/files/docker-compose.yaml) file.

### Docker Compose

A [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/cdot65/express-api-k8s/blob/main/files/docker-compose.yaml) file has been provided for local testing only.

Remember our goal is to deploy this to a k8s cluster.

## API methods

The URI for our API methods will end with `/tasks` or `/tasks/:taskId`

> post /tasks

![create](https://github.com/cdot65/express-api-k8s/blob/main/files/images/create.png?raw=true)

> get /tasks

![list](https://github.com/cdot65/express-api-k8s/blob/main/files/images/list.png?raw=true)

> delete /tasks/:taskId

![delete](https://github.com/cdot65/express-api-k8s/blob/main/files/images/delete.png?raw=true)

## Data Model

For our requests, we'll need to align ourselves with the data model defined in [files/nodejs/models/model.js](https://github.com/cdot65/express-api-k8s/blob/main/files/nodejs/models/model.js)

```javascript
// files/nodejs/models/model.js
const taskSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: {
        type: String,
        required: 'Enter the name of the task'
    },
    date_created: {
        type: Date,
        default: Date.now
    },
    status: {
        type: [{
            type: String,
            enum: ['pending', 'ongoing', 'completed']
        }],
        default: ['pending']
    }
});
```
